# webSockets
practicing a new concept with socket.io

This repository contains a basic sample project that uses WebSockets to create real-time communication between a client and a server.


This is a project made at the request of two fictional friends that we will use to exemplify: Eduarda and Juliana. They are two friends who are very fond of programming and sharing knowledge between them in real time using mongoDb and socket.io
